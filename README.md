# ALU
### Objectives  
•	To design and implement a parameterized ALU in Verilog which performs various arithmetic and logical operations.  
•	To develop the ALU using clean, modular, and synthesizable Verilog code while adhering to industry best practice.  
•	To create a detailed test plan that thoroughly tests all features and edge cases of the ALU.  
•	To create a self-checking testbench comprised of a driver, monitor, and scoreboard that takes input stimuli defined in a text file and verified outputs from the ALU.  
•	To conduct code coverage analysis to determine if all functionality paths and operations in the design were sufficiently tested.
